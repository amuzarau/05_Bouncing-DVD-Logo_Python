Bouncing DVD Logo. My educational project from Al Sweigart book “The Big Book of Small Python Projects”  

This program simulates this colorful ancient DVD logo by making it change direction each time it hits an edge. 
The program will also keep track of how many times a logo hits a corner of the screen.
